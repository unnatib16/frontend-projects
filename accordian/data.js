    title: "How were the Himalayas formed?",
    description: "Millions of years ago, the Indian tectonic plate collided with the Eurasian plate. This dramatic impact didn't just shake the Earth—it gave birth to the mighty Himalayas. The land buckled and rose, creating the youngest and tallest mountain range on our planet. And they're still growing! Every year, the Himalayas rise a few millimeters, slowly reaching for the sky."

    title: "Why are the Himalayas called the 'Third Pole'?",
    description: "The Himalayas are often referred to as the 'Third Pole' because they hold the largest reserve of ice and snow outside of the Arctic and Antarctic. The glaciers and snowfields here feed major rivers like the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra. For over a billion people living downstream, the Himalayas are not just mountains—they're lifelines."

    description: "Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, is not just tall—it's treacherous. Climbers face brutal winds, freezing temperatures, and thin oxygen levels in what's known as the 'death zone'. One misstep or sudden storm can be fatal. Yet, each year, many adventurers risk everything for a chance to stand on its summit, making Everest a symbol of both ambition and awe."
